# SPM - Simple Package Manager

## Philosophy:  
- Simple thing  
- No databases  
- Ports + Binaries (binaries are not currently supported though)  

## To-Do:  
- Stop the script when something goes wrong  
- Make the recipes autochange the PACKAGE variable to the original one after building a dependency  
- Make it clean the mess
- Change the structure of the scripts for functions  
- Versions  
- Upgrade ports and packages  
- Checksums and package signing

## Really Complex To-Do:  
- Recognize an upgrade or a install
- Add a bootstrap option  
- Make it difference a package installed voluntary from a package installed as a dependency  
- A proper remove option  
- A patch for ports system  
- Symlink everything where it should be
- More information  
- Packages on tars!  
- Multiple options:  
  - Install  
  - Search  
  - Show package information  
  - Build only  
  - Download sources only  
  - Check dependencies  
- Configurations:  
  - Build options  
  - Priority on upgrades

## Maybe To-Do:
- Colors?
